# ðŸš€ Gemma 

### Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.
Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemma have been shown to be effective at a variety of NLP tasks. An LLM is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a self-supervised fashion. Pre-training helps LLMs learn general-purpose knowledge, such as statistical relationships between words. An LLM can then be fine-tuned with domain-specific data to perform downstream tasks (such as sentiment analysis).

### Gemma 2 released! - 24 June 2024
Google just released the next iteration of its open LLM! Gemma 2 comes in two sizes, 9B & 27B, trained on 13T tokens. Gemma 2 27B approaches Meta Llama 3 70B performance!

# ðŸš€  KerasNLP 
### Keras 3 machine learning framework lets you write and run your code in JAX, Pytorch, or Tensorflow. 
Learn about Gemma, the large language model family of open models from Google. We will teach you basic and advanced LLM workflows, including chat generation, LoRA fine-tuning, model parallelism to train on large-scale infrastructure, style alignment, model surgery, and more.

New Keras + Hugging Face integration: you can now load HF fine-tuned models through Keras, even if they have not been fine-tuned in Keras. As long as the architecture is implemented in KerasNLP, weights will be converted on the fly.
